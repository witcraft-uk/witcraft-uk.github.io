 1. Complete the function <code>countOnes(n)</code> that takes a positive integer <code>n</code> and counts the total number of 1s in all the integers from <code>0</code> to <code>n</code>, inclusive.<br><br> 

2. Write a function that takes a positive integer <code>n</code> and returns the complement of <code>n</code> in the decimal of a value.<br><br> 

3. Consider a function that takes a positive integer <code>n</code> and returns the number of 1s in the decimal representation of all the integers from <code>0</code> to <code>n</code>, inclusive. For example, <code>f(13) = 6</code>, for the numbers 1, 10, 11 (twice, for two 1s), 12 and 13. Notice that <code>f(1) = 1</code>. After 1, what is the next largest <code>n</code> for which <code>f(n) = n</code>?<br><br> 

4. Write a function that finds the longest palindrome in a string.<br><br> 

5. Given an array of integers, output a list of four integers that sum to zero (the same input integer cannot be used multiple times), or indicate that no such set of four integers exists. For example, given the array <code>[2, 3, 1, 0, -4, -1]</code>, the set of four integers <code>(3 1 0 -4)</code> sums to zero. <br><br> 

6. By starting from the number 1, and repeatedly adding 5 and multiplying by 3, an infinite amount of new numbers can be produced. Write a function that, given a number, finds a sequence of additions and multiplications that produce that number.<br><br>
