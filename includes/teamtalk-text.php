		Team Talk is a quarterly magazine for internal communication at Bourne Leisure Group. I revamped its identity and did a complete overhaul at the time of its 50th issue. The new masthead conveys the idea of conversation through interweaving typography. The spreads continue with the modernist tone set by the cover.
