    I developed this educational tool for children attending pre-school and reception. The children are encouraged to hover the mouse over empty boxes to see the pictures magically appear, prompting them to click. When they click, the letters and word fade in describing the respective picture. I used randomised algorithm to load from over 100 pictures to enhance the learning experience. The core program is in PHP, while jQuery binds the click events. This application has generated plenty of interest at local nurseries. Watch this space for the commercial outing of this app.
