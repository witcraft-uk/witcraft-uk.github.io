<div class="copy-home witcraft">
I am currently developing my own proprietary application framework in PHP. This website will undergo CMS integration as a result of it. There is always a learning curve with any CMS framework including building your own. I would rather spend my days writing and amending my own program to handle what I need than face several megabytes of someone else's code.
