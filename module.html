    JavaScript modular programming
</div>
<div class="copy-home">
The module is written in core JavaScript and is supported in all major browsers including Internet Explorer 7 and above.

The module itself is completely self-contained in a global variable called albumModule. It can easily be implemented on external websites. 

The methods (private functions) are effectively namespaced inside albumModule, which can only be consumed by the module.

The module is scalable and extensible. Its architecture can adapt to changes in variable specifications.

The search field accepts positive integer values.
